# Security Log Analysis and Dashboarding in Splunk

## Overview
This project focuses on setting up Splunk, ingesting security logs, performing log analysis, and creating a dashboard to visualize security events. The main goal was to monitor and analyze security logs, specifically capturing instances of log clearing on my device.

## Key Steps & Implementation

### 1. Splunk Installation
- Installed and configured Splunk on a local system.
- Ensured Splunk was running and accessible via the web interface.

### 2. Configuring Log Ingestion
- Set up Splunk to capture security logs from my device.
- Verified that logs were properly indexed for analysis.

### 3. Basic Log Searching
- Used Splunk’s Search Processing Language (SPL) to query security logs.
- Identified key events related to security log clearing.

### 4. Creating a Table in Splunk
- Organized log data into a structured table format for improved readability.
- Applied filters to refine results and highlight critical security events.

### 5. Building a Dashboard
- Designed an interactive Splunk dashboard to display security log trends.
- Implemented visualizations such as event frequency charts and detailed log views.

### 6. Why Dashboards Are Useful
- Provides a real-time view of security log activities.
- Helps in quick detection of anomalies and unauthorized log clearing.
